### Stacks follow a Last in First Out (LIFO) structure, kind of like a stack of magazines; the last one placed on the stack is the first you can pick up. Arrays are initialized to size of 3. Drivers are provided to allow for testing of this data structure.
- *Stack.java*: Within this class you will find an array based Stack with resizing capabilities.
- *DriverArray.java*: Driver meant to be used to test Stack.java.
- *Layer.java*: Layer object used within the DriverBag class.
- *DriverBag.java*: Simulates a Stack of layers of items within a bag.
